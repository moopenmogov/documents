Working with AI is wild. Absolutely and unbelievably wild.

As I sit here I'm pairing with it to refactor a bunch of shoddy client side logic into a server side state matrix.

I mean, it's my fault for hacking it all together without insanely detailed planning and just wanting to move fast. But hot damn that creates such a mess when you layer on more features and "justs" and "or what about" and...pm's, you hear me?

But yeah that's how it works. And right now my assistant is doing the hard work to synthesize my contradictory logic and recursive click paths. It's working fairly quickly but it's also doing...who knows.

That's the problem. I've never built software in more than a recreational capacity, so building enterprise software is quite a jump for me. So as long as I pay attention every step of the way, including injecting myself while I see the LLM think dumb thoughts, it's useful. And when I let it go roam free, or give it vague and grandiose direction, it stumbles. It creates duplicate objects, conflicting logic, and still just makes shit up.

But it just finished the state matrix. And it did a good job. Great, actually. I certainly wouldn't have been anywhere near specific enough, or comprehensive.

It also sucked up more hours than I can count trying to debug and build extravagant logging systems to fix the core sync issue between the Word Add-In and the web viewer. Turned out we had a corrupt document and its base64 output was malformed. So we used a new document, and it worked. But that debugging process taught us a lot about platform unification.

**MAJOR WIN: UI/UX PLATFORM UNIFICATION**

Today we tackled a huge divergence problem - the Word add-in and web viewer had completely different button sets, behavior, and a critical bug where document operations opened new Word windows WITHOUT the add-in (losing all functionality).

The AI systematically:
1. Identified root causes (competing UI systems, timing races, dangerous fallbacks)
2. Deleted 1,402 lines of obsolete/duplicate code (including entire web-viewer.html)
3. Unified dropdown logic so both platforms work identically  
4. Created robust document handling with multiple fallback strategies
5. Added comprehensive testing and debugging tools

Result: Platforms now have identical functionality, the critical "new window" bug is eliminated, and we have robust error handling.

**What worked in this collaboration:**
- I provided strategic direction and domain knowledge
- AI did systematic debugging, pattern recognition, and robust implementation
- Clear problem statement + iterative feedback loops
- AI's strength: handling complex state synchronization and error cases
- My strength: knowing what the user experience should be

This is exactly the kind of work that would have taken me weeks to untangle solo, but together we knocked it out systematically in a few hours. The key was staying engaged and course-correcting when needed, but letting the AI handle the tedious implementation details.
