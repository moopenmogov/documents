Working with AI is wild. Absolutely and unbelievably wild.

As I sit here I'm pairing with it to refactor a bunch of shoddy client side logic into a server side state matrix.

I mean, it's my fault for hacking it all together without insanely detailed planning and just wanting to move fast. But hot damn that creates such a mess when you layer on more features and "justs" and "or what about" and...pm's, you hear me?

But yeah that's how it works. And right now my assistant is doing the hard work to synthesize my contradictory logic and recursive click paths. It's working fairly quickly but it's also doing...who knows.

That's the problem. I've never built software in more than a recreational capacity, so building enterprise software is quite a jump for me. So as long as I pay attention every step of the way, including injecting myself while I see the LLM think dumb thoughts, it's useful. And when I let it go roam free, or give it vague and grandiose direction, it stumbles. It creates duplicate objects, conflicting logic, and still just makes shit up.

It also sucked up more hours than I can count trying to debug and build extravagant logging systems to fix the core sync issue between the Word Add-In and the web viewer. Turned out we had a corrupt document and its base64 output was malformed. So we used a new document, and it
