Fix sync issue from jen
--don't auto-update the browser, only pull 
--or always be available to everyone concurrently

currently auto-updating when user loads (I think) - don't auto-update within a single user context

give people the option of editing and not auto-loading upon check-out initialization

jen's feedback: default would be real-time editing and real-time sync and check-out would be the block on that
